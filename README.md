# Gradient-Descent-Machine-Learning
Using Gradient Descent to minimize the Cost Function in ML

# Introduction
- The goal of this code is to show how gradient descent can automate the process of 
optimizing the cost function paramters J(w,b)

- we also see what happens when we adjust the learning rate alpha


# Notes

** i have added clear instructions in the python file itself, it will guide any beginner
