# Gradient-Descent-Machine-Learning
Using Gradient Descent to minimize the Cost Function in ML
The goal of this code is to show how gradient descent can automate the process of 
optimizing the cost function paramters J(w,b) 
we also see what happens when we adjust the learning rate alpha

** i have added clear instructions in the python file itself, it will guide any beginner
